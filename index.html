                            Hello! My name is Dan. I'm a hacker, which means I enjoy acquiring a deep understanding of 
                            systems and using them in novel and interesting ways beyond their intended purposes.
                            I also enjoy building new systems and websites from configuirng the servers (or going serverless) 
                            to designing intuitive user interfaces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I strive to use the skills I learn in individual areas and apply them to all of my pursuits. My experience as a developer informs how I look for flaws 
                            while security testing and my knowledge of security practices allows me to develop secure systems. Whether I'm performing security assessments or 
                            developing, I always aim to create the best possible experience for clients and end users. I believe that security does not 
                            have to come at the price of usability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I feel the most accomplished when I'm able to work on projects that benefit others.  That's why 
                            I make my projects open source when I'm able and why I volunteer my time to causes I'm passionate 
                            about. With everything I work on, I hope to leve it better than I found it.
                        </p>
